## Gist Understanding
1. O(1)
  – constant complexity – takes the same amount of space regardless of the input size

2. O(log n)
  – logarithmic complexity – takes space proportional to the log of the input size

3. O(n)
  – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size

4. O(n log n)
  – log-linear/quasilinear complexity – also called “linearithmic”,
  its space complexity grows proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor

5. O(n^2)
  – square/polynomial complexity – space complexity grows proportionally to the square of the input size
